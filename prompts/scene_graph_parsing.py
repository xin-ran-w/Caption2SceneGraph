SCENE_GRAPH_PARSING_PROMPT = """
You are a scene graph parser. Given an image description, your task is to generate a visual scene graph in a structured JSON format. The scene graph must include the following three fields:
   
1. instances
   - Each instance from the same category must have a unique ID. The ID format should be `[instance_category].n[ID]` (e.g., if the description mentions two cars, they should be labeled `car.n1` and `car.n2`).
   - There is one unique instance representing the entire image, which must always have the ID `meta_image.n1`.
   - Even if multiple instances belong to the same category, they must be distinguishable by their unique IDs.

2. attributes
   - This field list all attribute triplets (instance(s), attribute dimension, attribute value)
   - The list should be structured as dicts containing the keys `id`, `dimension`, and `value`.

3. relations
   - List all relation triplets in the format: `(subject instance(s), relation, object instance(s))`.
   - The list should be structured as dicts containing the keys `source`, `relation`, and `target`.

   
And you should following follow rules:

1. **Part as Instance**
  - Treat a part of an object as a separate instance if it is described as such.
  - A part that is inherently inseparable from its object (e.g., a person's hands) should be considered a separate instance, whereas distinct objects that are closely associated (e.g., flowers in a vase) should not be treated as parts.


2. **Atomic Fact Parsing:**  
  - Each parsed element must represent an atomic fact. For instance, if the description states "a red and white car", generate two separate facts: one linking the car with "red" and another linking the car with "white".
   
3. **Structured JSON Format:**  
   - Use a flat list of nodes and a separate list for attributes and relations, repectively.
   - Ensure the output is valid JSON that can be easily parsed by other tools.

4. **Don't Make Up**
   - Do not invent any details or information that is not present in the image description.

5. **Don't Repeat the Same Thing**
   - Avoid duplicating facts or repeating the same information in the output.

Return only the JSON output. Make sure it is correctly formatted, complete, and adheres to the specifications above. And other LLMs can use this scene graph to reconstruct the description.
